# Introduction

[IELTS Speaking Simulator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-uGueIrCsT-ielts-speaking-simulator) is a GPT based on ChatGPT. It accurately simulates the IELTS speaking test, choosing questions from the latest question bank. It assesses and refines your responses after the conversation, offering a more realistic practice than doing it solo.


# V3 Update

[IELTS Speaking Simulation GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-uGueIrCsT-ielts-speaking-simulator) V3 update:

1. Updated with the latest question bank for May-August 2024.
2. Improved stability in random question selection.
3. Better experience by automatically asking if you want to improve your answers after the simulation.

*Note: The voice feature is still the old version. The real-time features shown at the GPT-4o launch are not available yet.*

GPT-4o is gradually being rolled out. Some free users can now access GPTs directly. If you can‚Äôt use it yet, please wait or subscribe to Plus. (Currently, free users can have 16 conversations every 3 hours, which is sufficient for trial purpose. For full practice, consider subscribing to ChatGPT Plus.)

To help more people understand and use this tool, here is the complete user guide and the open-source project details.

# User Guide

## Prerequisites

1. [IELTS Speaking Simulation](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-uGueIrCsT-ielts-speaking-simulator) is based on ChatGPT‚Äôs GPTs and voice functionality. Currently, the voice feature is only available in the official ChatGPT app. Download the ChatGPT app from the App Store and Google Play.

2. Visit the [IELTS Speaking Simulation](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-uGueIrCsT-ielts-speaking-simulator) link. If you can‚Äôt interact with it, your account may not have free access to GPTs. To use it, subscribe to ChatGPT Plus.

![](https://github.com/hubeiqiao/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator/blob/main/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_pic_en/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_en%201.png)

If you have subscribed to ChatGPT Plus, you can also [download the macOS version of the ChatGPT app](https://community.openai.com/t/downloading-the-new-desktop-app-for-chatgpt/746857) (requires at least M1 chip) to interact directly on your computer. I think it provides a better experience in voice mode.

## Finding the [IELTS Speaking Simulation](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-uGueIrCsT-ielts-speaking-simulator)

### Method 1: Through the Link

With the ChatGPT app installed, use Chrome/Safari browser to open the [IELTS Speaking Simulation](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-uGueIrCsT-ielts-speaking-simulator) link. This will directly open the GPT in the ChatGPT app.

To make it easier to access next time, click on the name at the top of the page, then select ‚ÄúKeep in Sidebar.‚Äù This will allow you to access it directly from the sidebar in the future.

![](https://github.com/hubeiqiao/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator/blob/main/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_pic_en/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_en%202.png)

Finally, to better simulate a fully English conversation environment, it is recommended to set the main language of SPEECH to English in the ChatGPT application settings.

### Method 2: Search

If the link doesn‚Äôt open the app directly, you can find it through search.

1. Open the ChatGPT app, pull out the sidebar, click ‚ÄúExplore GPTs‚Äù, then click the search button at the top right.

![](https://github.com/hubeiqiao/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator/blob/main/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_pic_en/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_en%203.png)

2. In the search box, type ‚ÄùIELTS Speaking Simulator‚Äù, and find the GPT with the information shown in the image.

![](https://github.com/hubeiqiao/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator/blob/main/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_pic_en/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_en%204.png)

3. Since the temporary page from the search result doesn‚Äôt support the voice feature, click the name at the top of the page and select ‚ÄúKeep in Sidebar.‚Äù Then, return to the homepage, find the GPT in the sidebar, and click to use it.

![](https://github.com/hubeiqiao/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator/blob/main/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_pic_en/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_en%205.png)

4. Finally, to better simulate a fully English conversation environment, it is recommended to set the main language of SPEECH to English in the ChatGPT application settings.

# Daily Use

*Note: As of May 2024, the real-time voice feature of GPT-4o is not publicly available. The current version still uses the old version functionality released last year.*

1. Find the [IELTS Speaking Simulation](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-uGueIrCsT-ielts-speaking-simulator) in the Sidebar and select the module you want to simulate. For first-time use, you need to grant permission for external interface calls; choose ‚ÄúAlways allow.‚Äù After the questions are drawn, click the voice mode button at the bottom right to start the simulation.

![](https://github.com/hubeiqiao/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator/blob/main/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_pic_en/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_en%206.png)

(You can also start the conversation directly by telling it which module you want to simulate. However, sometimes it may not call the interface to draw questions, so it is recommended to manually select the module for more stability).

2. During the conversation, if there is a pause, the current input will be interrupted and sent to ChatGPT. If your speech is not fluent enough (especially in Part 2 & Part 3), you can press and hold the center circle while speaking to ensure continuous recording even during pauses. For Part 2, after being informed of the topic, you need to time yourself for 1 minute before starting to speak.

3. After completing the specified module simulation, the system will automatically score your speaking. You can then follow the system prompts to optimize your answers. Due to the length of the content, each part will be output separately. 

![](https://github.com/hubeiqiao/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator/blob/main/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_pic_en/IELTS%20Speaking%20Simulator%20V3%20Update_en%208.png)

4. Finally, according to the system prompts, you can summarize the questions and vocabulary used in the simulation. If you have additional needs, you can input them to get further feedback.

# Current Issues

1. The score estimation is for reference only (pronunciation is completely inaccurate because the current voice mode converts speech to text. Future real-time voice conversation with GPT-4o may improve this). The main benefit of this GPT is that it offers an authentic practice experience.
2. Part 1 can sometimes be problematic:
    - Although the number of questions in Part 1 is limited, it sometimes still ask more than ten questions.
    - Even when the prompt clearly states not to repeat questions, it sometimes continues to ask questions that were answered or mentioned in the previous answer.
3. When providing revised answers, it might miss questions. For example, Part 1 might only give partial answers, or Part 2 might provide insufficient information. You will need to correct it explicitly in such cases.
4. In rare cases, it might display all the drawn questions at once. Fortunately, V3 is much better than before.

If you encounter other issues, feel free to provide feedback or optimize the prompt yourself (I have shard the prompt and question bank for each version. You can download them by clicking on Releases).

Additionally, the voice mode is relatively unstable (affected by OpenAI and your network). Sometimes it might not connect. Try switching to a more stable network or wait a while before trying again. When the network is unstable, not only might you fail to connect, but you might also find that after speaking for a while, ChatGPT informs you that the current usage is high and asks you to try again. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

# Additional Thoughts

1. After the GPT-4 update to version 20240409 in April 2024, the initial success rate of question selection with the Code Interpreter significantly improved. However, a week later, it deteriorated, requiring multiple retries to successfully select questions. After trying various methods without success, I updated the random question selection module from ChatGPT‚Äôs built-in Code Interpreter to using external interfaces with Actions. This was my first time creating my own interface, indirectly indicating that ChatGPT‚Äôs capabilities are still lacking. I look forward to future improvement with GPT-5.
2. Time flies; it has been nearly six months since this GPT was released. During this period, I have simulated multiple times myself, but honestly, I feel my score has only improved by about 0.5 at most. It hasn‚Äôt led to significant leaps in improvement. This is partly because I don‚Äôt have an immediate need for the exam and haven‚Äôt reviewed each practice session thoroughly. If future AI can actively identify unknown issues based on my practice and provide targeted exercises and feedback, that would be impressive.
3. For me, the more important aspect is gaining confidence and having something to talk about on various topics. I hope to use this when I retake the IELTS exam in two years (my goal is modest‚Äîscoring a 7 in speaking is sufficient).
4. In terms of experience, current AI still has a long way to go. Otherwise, I wouldn‚Äôt need to write such detailed usage guides. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

<summary><h1> Thoughts at the Initial Release</h1></summary>

<p>
(Written in December 2023)

## Thoughts During Learning
1. I've tried other speaking practice GPTs, but they often revolve around familiar topics. However, for IELTS practice, a framework with clear standards seems more suitable, even though I don't currently need it for IELTS.
2. Memorization or sticking to specific topics isn't necessary for IELTS speaking preparation. Treating it as spontaneous practice works better. For topics that are difficult to explain, just remembering the framework and keywords afterwards is enough.
3. Honestly, this is the best GPT I've used so far. Considering the cost of individual speaking practice, paying $20 or more per month offers great value. I hope consistent practice will help reduce my conversation anxiety. This is just a start, and I might explore GPTs for behavioral interviews next year.
4. A friend once said any method works for learning English, as long as you stick with it. Seeking efficiency might be a trap if you want fluency. This insight comes from my last preparation experience. Here's an article I wrote previously: "[Expectation vs. Reality: A Deep Dive into AI-Assisted Language Learning](https://hubeiqiao.notion.site/Expectation-vs-Reality-A-Deep-Dive-into-AI-Assisted-Language-Learning-2ebf7d1fc3224e9486b3be81f48d25ab?pvs=4)"

## Sharing the Making Process
1. I've attached [the current instructions](https://github.com/hubeiqiao/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator/blob/main/IELTS-Speaking-Simulator_Instructrion_20231215.txt) for this GPT in an attachment. You can copy them to create your own GPTs and customize the process or question bank.
2. The biggest challenge in creating this GPT was figuring out how to enable it to randomly select questions from the question bank. Despite many prompt modifications, it wasn't random but followed a fixed cycle. Fortunately, with [@goldengrape](https://twitter.com/goldengrape)'s hint, I realized that Knowledge can upload Python scripts for execution with the Code Interpreter, which solved the issue. I also considered using Actions to connect to external interfaces, but using external Actions on a GPT prevents it from being used on mobile, thereby losing the voice conversation feature.
3. Other similar GPT experiences usually present all questions under a Topic. Initially, I encountered the same issue, but after numerous modifications, I managed to somewhat resolve it (not guaranteed, retry if needed).
4. The question bank in the attachment is compiled by IETLS Brother and covers the months from September to December 2023. The question bank in the current GPT has been updated to include questions from January to April 2024.

## Why share
1. This GPT is for my use and exploring possibilities, and it's all still very new. Practicing daily, I've come to think of it as the best in its category, silently admiring its capabilities. Since I've created it, I figured why not let friends with similar interests benefit from it too.
2. More frankly, there's nothing to hide, as the Instructions can be obtained through Prompt skills(I didn't consider adding protection to the Prompt, as there are always ways to get around it). So, it's better to make it public for everyone.
3. From a product perspective, with hundreds of users now, I need to be more careful with updates. Sharing it publicly allows everyone to tweak it to their needs and provide feedback for improvements.
4. It's not just about conversation practice. What's equally important is the organized learning afterwards. Seeing different methods of use and discovering new content or skills that I'm unaware of would be fantastic.
5. ChatGPT is like a big toy right now. But, in language learning, it shows immense promise. I hope this inspires developers to create even better products.

Finally, a big thank you to Sam and OpenAI(["A Year with ChatGPT: Personal Reflections and Transformation"](https://hubeiqiao.notion.site/A-Year-with-ChatGPT-Personal-Reflections-and-Transformation-a69865a83beb4a4d8bbaf2adde71ab0d?pvs=4)). I never imagined I could create such a product so quickly on my own. It indirectly shows how Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will revolutionize society in the coming years. For ordinary people like us, the most practical advice is to experience these products in real scenarios. This is just the beginning and requires more patience.
